I'm a physiological ecologist who studies how plants use water and energy. I'm particularly interested in understanding how plants survive in challenging environments. For example, how do trees cope with prolonged drought? What about infection by disease? Most recently I have been developing tools to better measure water loss from leaves using thermal infrared cameras and applying them to forest canopies in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. I'm always keen to share my code and ideas, so please take a look at my [github](https://github.com/pageg/) repositories or contact me via [email]({{ site.url }}/Contact.html).

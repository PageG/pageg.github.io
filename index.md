I'm an ecologist working at the intersection of plant physiological ecology and remote sensing. I'm particularly interested in understanding how plants survive in challenging environments. For example, how do trees cope with prolonged drought? What about infection by disease? I'm currently working to understand the restoration potential of rangeland ecosystems in Western Australia using a combination of field data, near-surface remote sensing and satellite remote sensing data. I'm also continuing to develop tools to better understand the dynamics of leaf temperature across a range of ecosystems types in North America. I'm always keen to share my code and ideas, so please take a look at my [github](https://github.com/pageg/) repositories or contact me via [email]({{ site.url }}/Contact.html).

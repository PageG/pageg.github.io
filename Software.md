##Imaging PAM## [[example here]](https://pageg.github.io/batch_process_fvfm_example.html) [[github hepo here]](https://github.com/PageG/IM-PAM)

A demonstration of functions to import and process chlorophyll fluorescence images, written in Matlab.

These data were collected using an M-series Imaging PAM fitted with an IMAG-MIN/B measuring head, Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany. Parameters calculated with the Matlab functions are from formalae described in the Imaging PAM manual.

Data were first exported as a TIFF stack from the PIM format using Walz ImagingWin software (tested with ImagingWin v2.46i).

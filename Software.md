### Imaging PAM 
[[example here]](https://pageg.github.io/batch_process_fvfm_example.html) [[github hepo here]](https://github.com/PageG/IM-PAM)

A collection of functions and scripts to import and process chlorophyll fluorescence images, written in Matlab. These data were collected using an M-series Imaging PAM fitted with an IMAG-MIN/B measuring head (Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). Parameters calculated with the Matlab functions are from formalae described in the Imaging PAM manual. Data were first exported as a TIFF stack from the PIM format using Walz ImagingWin software (tested with ImagingWin v2.46i).

### Processing fixed-mount thermal imagery 
[[example here]](https://pageg.github.io/process_thermal_images.html) [[github repo here]](https://github.com/PageG/Holden_Thermal)

This is a demonstration script written in R-markdown for importing, correcting and analysing thermal images of a forest canopy. Data were collected using a FLIR A325sc thermal camera when I was an instructor for PhysFestII at Holden Arboretum in July 2018 [[PhysfestII Link]](https://www.k-state.edu/ecophyslab/phys_fest_2.html). This script uses the ['Thermimage' R package](https://github.com/gtatters/Thermimage).

### sapfluxR 
*coming soon*

An R package for importing and processing Heat Ratio Method (HRM) sapflow data.
